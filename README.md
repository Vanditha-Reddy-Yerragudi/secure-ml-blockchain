# **Secure ML-Powered Financial Transactions**  
Secure and decentralized financial transactions using predictive models with ML + Blockchain 

## **Project Overview**  
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Blockchain technologies to enable secure, transparent, and decentralized financial transactions. By combining ML-based predictive models with blockchain's immutable ledger, the system ensures data security and fraud detection while maintaining transparency and decentralization.  


## **Key Features**  
**Secure ML-based predictions** – Predict financial outcomes using ML models.

**Blockchain-based decentralization** – Ensures tamper-proof and transparent transaction records.  

**Flask-based API** – Provides a simple interface for transaction execution and monitoring. 

**Fraud detection** – ML model identifies suspicious transaction patterns.  

**Scalability** – Designed to handle high-volume transactions efficiently.  


## **Technologies Used**  
**Python** : Core programming language for building ML models and Flask API.

**Flask** : Web framework to create RESTful APIs.

**TensorFlow** : Machine Learning library for predictive modeling.

**Web3.py** : Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

**Ethereum Testnet** : Blockchain network used for testing and deploying smart contracts.

**Solidity** : Smart contract development.


## **How It Works**  
1. **User submits a transaction** – Transaction details are sent through the Flask-based API.
  
2. **ML model prediction** – The ML model predicts transaction risk and verifies authenticity.

3. **Blockchain recording** – Verified transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.py.

4. **User feedback** – Success or failure message is sent back to the user.
